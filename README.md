<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings</h2>

<p>
This project was a great learning! Working part time on it for two weeks I have completed it.I went beyond and learned and implmented angular based project here. Researching for every function that I thought to implement was a learning of its own. I have learned something great for each page that I built, if not many things for page. I tried to get the project as close to deployable that I could inside the timeline that I set for myself. That challanged me to think what could go wrong and what could function better in every entry that I did.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Considerations</h2>

- Layout was based on Web and mobile.
- I had many other pages to implement, but considering the time needed to implement all, So I'm submitting it as it is. Maybe in the future I can get it to deploy stage.
